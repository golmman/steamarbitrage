# steamarbitrage
Bot which takes advantage of arbitrage in valve's steam market

The bot tries to find cheap offers on http://steamcommunity.com/ and buys them automatically.

Run the main method in SteamArbitrage.java to test it. 
Unfortunatly steam changed the allowed queries per minute from ~60 to 3-4, so I am not running it anymore.
Feel free to use and improve it as you like.
